France football captain Kylian Mbapp√© is "astonished" to see his name linked in media reports to a rape inquiry in Sweden, but his lawyer says the player is calm because he has nothing to be sorry about.

Swedish authorities have confirmed that a senior prosecutor is investigating a report of a suspected rape in Stockholm, without naming anyone in connection with the case.

However, Swedish media report that the French footballer is being linked to the allegations which involve an incident at a hotel in central Stockholm last Thursday.
